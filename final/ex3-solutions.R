#  Implement the body of the function 'keepDoubleQuotesOnly' below so that
#  it returns a character vector containing only the elements 
#  of the character vector 'theString' (passed as a function argument)
#  that have more than one double quoted string.
#  
#  For example, if the following strings 
#  
#  this "line" has "quoted" "strings"
#  "one" more to follow "two"
#  "a""b"
#  there's "one" quoted string
#  Here's a quote "
#  No quotes here
#  
#  are the elements of the character vector 'theString',
#  then the function should return a character vector 
#  with the three first strings only. 



keepDoubleQuotesOnly = function(theString){
   # Write your code here 
   pattern = '([^"]*"[^"]*"){2}'
   theString[grep(pattern, theString)]

}
